        "Bootstrap self-learning by (soft/hard)pseudo-labelling unlabelled images with a teacher network initially trained on ImageNet and train a noisy student (with equal or greater capacity than the teacher) on the combination of labelled and unlabelled datasets. This student is expected to be better than the teacher network due to noise and higher representational capacity. This student network is then the next teacher network and the process repeats. The resulting network yields higher accuracy and also better robustness to perturbations in the images (noise, occlusion, etc.)."
